# GrADyS-SIM NextGen Visualization
This is a visualization tool for [GrADyS-SIM-Nextgen](https://github.com/Project-GrADyS/gradys-sim-nextgen). It connects to a running simulation
through a WebSocket server opened by the simulator's visualization component. More information about how it works can be found in the [project's documentation](https://project-gradys.github.io/gradys-sim-nextgen/Modules/Simulator/handlers/visualization/).

The visualization tool can be accessed in: https://project-gradys.github.io/gradys-sim-nextgen-visualization/
